## What I used to construct the Pixel Art Maker
I created the Pixel Art Maker using
1. The shell code you provided,
2. jQuery linked from the Google CDN
3. My Own CSS
4. Bootstrap Css for gridding

## Comments

- I decided to restrict the grid to 30 squares high and 50 squares wide to allow for a good drawing experience when using a large computer
- I went for a minimalistic background and lots of white space to keep the design clean and allow for a more engaging exerience with few other distractions
- **Thank you for the opportunity to learn the basics of Front End Development. I previously used other peoples templates and would never dare to touch their js code for fear of breaking the website. Now, I think I have a better grasp of the three elements (html, js and css) and I wil be able to deliver better projects to my freelance clients while growing my skills to becoming a proper front end web developer.**
